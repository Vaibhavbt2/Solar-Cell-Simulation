# Solar-Cell-Simulation

This repository contains a Python-based simulation of a **Silicon PN junction solar cell**.  
The project was developed as part of my M.Sc. Physics coursework and focuses on numerical modeling of basic semiconductor device physics.  

The notebook demonstrates:
- Electrostatic potential across the PN junction
- Dark current–voltage (J–V) characteristics
- Optical generation profile and carrier collection probability
- Illuminated J–V curve and solar cell performance
